CodeBook.txt

This codebook describes the variables used from the UCI HAR Data and how they are organized in the TidyDataResult.txt file produced by the run_analysis.R script.  The resulting data set is tall and narrow.

Note that the assumption is that the UCI HAR Data is in your working directory, and the run_analysis.R script is also in that directory.

Variables in the R script:
varNames: a collection of the names taken from ./UCI HAR Dataset/features.txt (factors)

DATA FROM THE TRAIN DIRECTORY
trainSubject: a vector of subject numbers taken from ./UCI HAR Dataset/train/subject_train.txt
trainX: a data frame of the measured variables (names in varNames) taken from ./UCI HAR Dataset/train/X_train.txt
trainY: a data frame of the activities performed by each subject taken from ./UCI HAR Dataset/train/y_train.txt
trainYF: is a vector of factors with the numbers of activity replaced by their descriptive variable names (these are the same names found in ./UCI HAR Dataset/activity_labels.txt

DATA FROM THE TEST DIRECTORY
testSubject: a vector of subject numbers taken from ./UCI HAR Dataset/test/subject_test.txt
testX: a data frame of the measured variables (names in varNames) taken from ./UCI HAR Dataset/test/X_test.txt
testY: a data frame of the activities performed by each subject taken from ./UCI HAR Dataset/test/y_test.txt
testYF: is a vector of factors with the numbers of activity replaced by their descriptive variable names (these are the same names found in ./UCI HAR Dataset/activity_labels.txt

FIRST UNTIDY DATA SET (result is very tall and narrow, because there are many more rows than columns)
Part 1 comes from column binding the training sets together in left-to-right order:
trainSubject trainYF trainX (subject, activity, measurements)

Part 2 comes from column binding the test sets together in left-to-right order:
testSubject testYF testX (subject, activity, measurements)

These two parts are combined by row binding the two previous sets, stacking the training set above the test set
in untidyData1

SECOND UNTIDY DATA SET
The second untidy data set comes from selecting only the columns of the untidyData1 that correspond to means and standard deviation variables.  These are chosen by selecting column names that contain either of those terms
The result is stored in untidyData2
** The variables included are a subset of those in ./UCI HAR Dataset/features.txt and are listed below the 
rest of the material in this codebook.

TIDY DATA SET
The second untidy data set contains multiple observations per subject per activity.  Using the data.table package in R, these multiple results are combined into the average of all observations per subject per activity resulting in a data table that has only six rows per subject, each row containing observations for each subject for one activity
The result is stored in tidyTable

TEXT FILE TABLE OUTPUT
The write.table function (row.name = FALSE) is applied to tidyTable and writes the tidy table to TidyDataResult.txt which is saved in the working directory.

#########################################################
VARIABLE MEASUREMENTS INCLUDED IN THE FINAL OUTPUT (note: means taken for each one as discussed in the TIDY DATA SET section above)  These correspond to columns (after subject and activity) in the final table.  The numbers below refer to the original list (in the features.txt file) but not the number of appearance in the output as column headers.
